## Inspiration
We realized that majority of people stop going to gym because they have no friends to join and keep them motivated. Also, moms may not be able to afford or find trusted babysitters multiple times a week to go to gym. Similarly, not everyone can afford personal trainers. So we wanted to help them.
## What it does
You sign up with our website and fill out a super quick form (your age, with city you are in etc.) to find health buddies. Together with your health buddies you can go to gym and motivate each other, split the cost of personal trainer or babysitter to make the exercising more convenient and less expensive.
## How we built it
We used Django framework and coded the project in Python, HTML and CSS.
## Challenges we ran into
User login system and database took way much more time than we expected and left us with very little time to do the rest of the project.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have made a dependable user system which can be utilized to expand and add more functionalities to the project.
## What we learned
Mainly how time consuming the backend development is :) Also, we learned Django from scratch which is a big win for us.
## What's next for HealthBuddy
We will add a filtering system to further help our users to find friends not just based on their location (as of now our only current option) but also based on sports (basketball, table tennis, swimming, weight lifting etc.). In addition to that we also want to show nearby gyms and supplement/healthy food retailers to our users as well.
